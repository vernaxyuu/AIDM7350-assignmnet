At present, there are more than 13 million autistic people in China. The number of children under the age of 18 with autism spectrum disorder may exceed 4 million.</h2>

        <h1>Autism is psychosis</h1>
        <p>Autism is actually a type of generalized developmental disorder. In the early days, autism was thought to be a child mental illness caused by poor parenting, and was even classified as schizophrenia. However, it was later found that autism is actually a physical developmental disorder, which is different from the "hardware damage" of deaf and mute blind children, and autism is the failure of the "software system" such as the brain nervous system.</p>

        <h1>The prevalence of autism is low</h1>
        <p>Autism is actually a developmental disorder in children with a high prevalence. There are 1.5 million to 2 million children with autism in China, and according to the data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every 68 children in the United States have 1 autism, and the data in other countries is even higher. It shows that autism is already a global epidemic among children, and the relatively low prevalence rate in China is due to limited medical conditions and insufficient consultation rate.</p>

        <h1>Autism is introversion</h1>
        <p>Autism is not the inability to speak, but the inability to understand and speak. The vast majority of children with autism appear to be unable to understand the meaning of language, and thus unable to organize the correct feedback of language. But this does not mean that children do not have the desire to communicate, they will also be anxious because they can not express, just do not show it, easy to be mistaken for introverted, high and cold.</p>

        <h1>Talking is not autism</h1> 
        <p>Language impairment is not a necessary symptom of autism, and autism also has functional differences. Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder, includes Asperger's syndrome, a type that has no obvious language or intellectual impairment, but also has symptoms such as lack of interest, stereotyped behavior, and social difficulties. Therefore, the ability to speak is not entirely a basis for autism, but depends on specific regional divisions.</p>
